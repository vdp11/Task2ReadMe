## Installation

Create a Local Repository:

Create a new folder on your computer where you want to store your project.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder using the cd command. For example:


cd path/to/your/folder
Initialize a Git repository in this folder:

git init
Create Your Project:

Add all the files and content of your personal webpage project to this folder. Ensure that you have an index.html file and all other necessary files.
Create a README:

You can create a README file (e.g., README.md) in the same folder. You can use a text editor to create and edit this file.
Add and Commit Your Changes:

In your terminal, add all the files to the staging area:

git add .
Commit your changes with a commit message:

git commit -m "Initial commit"
Create a GitHub Repository:

Go to GitHub.
Log in to your GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free.
Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New Repository."
Repository Settings:

Fill in the repository name, for example, "your-name-personal-website" (replace "your-name" with your GitHub username).
Add a description if you'd like.
Choose the visibility as "Public" to make your repository accessible.
Initialize this repository with a README by checking the box.
Create the Repository:

Click the "Create repository" button.
Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub:

Push your local repository to GitHub:
